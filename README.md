As mentioned in the tutorial, I learned each step involved in designing a simple Flutter layout. I explored how to structure the layout using different classes such as Title, Text, Button, and Image sections, and how these components can be used as children within the body widget, enhanced by the SingleChildScrollView for smooth scrolling. Additionally, I gained an understanding of how to modify the styles and visual design of the layout to improve its overall appearance and user experience.
